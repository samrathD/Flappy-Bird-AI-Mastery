# Flappy Bird : AI Mastery

## Project Overview
Flappy Bird: AI Mastery is a project that leverages the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) genetic algorithm to develop an AI agent proficient in playing Flappy Bird. The project employs evolutionary algorithms and neural networks to train and evolve AI agents, aiming to enhance their gameplay performance continuously

## Features
- Utilizes the NEAT genetic algorithm to evolve AI agents.
- Coordinates the evolution of 50 distinct AI agents per generation.
- Maximizes learning diversity and accelerates performance enhancement.
- Continuously refines the neural network architecture.
- Optimizes evolutionary parameters for improved AI gameplay.

## Installation
To use this program clone the repository and run the python program. You can also cnage the number of birds by editing the "pop-size" in the configuration file
